# AirBnB-Clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It is a full-stack development application, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

 ## Team Roles goes as follows ;
 ##### Technology Stack Breakdown:
 Explore the technologies used in this scalable project and their specific contributions to achieving project goals.

 ##### Database Design Proficiency:
 Plan and document a relational database structure with entities, attributes, and relationships that mirror real-world requirements.

 ##### Feature-Driven Development:
 Identify and describe core features of the application, focusing on their relevance to the user experience and business logic.

##### API Security Fundamentals:
  Implement and document key security measures to safeguard application data and ensure secure transactions.

  ##### CI/CD Pipeline Integration:
 setting up automated development pipelines, boosting efficiency and minimizing errors during the deployment phase.

 In this project, the following technologies will be used- Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL
 ###### Django : A web framework used for building restful API's
 ###### PostgresSQL : Database to store data and manage  records in rows ans columns
 ###### GraphQL : An API layer for communicating between the backend and frontend

  -Rate limiting is  a security  measures thats ensures how many requests a user, device, or IP address can send to the  API or server in a certain amount of time
  - This is important because it prevents the application from crashing as a result to too many request sent to the server within a given time.
